RANGES OF NUMBERS
When writing ranges of numbers in text, the word “through” or “to” should be used to connect them.

Example:
Samples 6 through 10 were reacted in a similar manner but at approximately 100°C.

When the ranges are numbers of several digits, no digits from the 2nd number in the range should be omitted.
32
Example:
1938 through 1942
[not “1938–42”]
