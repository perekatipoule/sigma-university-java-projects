FORMATTING NUMBERS
In numbers of 2 to 4 digits, the numerals are run together, i.e., no extra spaces are used.

Examples:
35        789        1200        5486

In numbers of more than 4 digits, British and American English mark off groups of 3 digits with commas. The European convention (ISO 1992a) is to separate groups of 3 digits with periods.

Examples:
5,450,000      60,780,000      [British and American]
5.450.000      60.780.000      [European]

Whereas British and American English uses decimal points, European convention uses decimal commas.

Examples:
5.4      7.9      [British and American]
5,4      7,9      [European]
