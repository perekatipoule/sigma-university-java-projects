Encoding
The Ascii Character Set Is The Most Common Compatible Subset Of Character Sets For English-language Text Files, And Is Generally Assumed To Be The Default File Format In Many Situations. It Covers American English, But For The British Pound Sign, The Euro Sign, Or Characters Used Outside English, A Richer Character Set Must Be Used. In Many Systems, This Is Chosen Based On The Default Locale Setting On The Computer It Is Read On. Prior To Utf-8, This Was Traditionally Single-byte Encodings (such As Iso-8859-1 Through Iso-8859-16) For European Languages And Wide Character Encodings For Asian Languages.
