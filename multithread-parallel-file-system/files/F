Because Encodings Necessarily Have Only A Limited Repertoire Of Characters, Often Very Small, Many Are Only Usable To Represent Text In A Limited Subset Of Human Languages. Unicode Is An Attempt To Create A Common Standard For Representing All Known Languages, And Most Known Character Sets Are Subsets Of The Very Large Unicode Character Set. Although There Are Multiple Character Encodings Available For Unicode, The Most Common Is Utf-8, Which Has The Advantage Of Being Backwards-compatible With Ascii; That Is, Every Ascii Text File Is Also A Utf-8 Text File With Identical Meaning. Utf-8 Also Has The Advantage That It Is Easily Auto-detectable. Thus, A Common Operating Mode Of Utf-8 Capable Software, When Opening Files Of Unknown Encoding, Is To Try Utf-8 First And Fall Back To A Locale Dependent Legacy Encoding When It Definitely Isn't Utf-8.
